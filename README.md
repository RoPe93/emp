strongmsgd
=====
StrongMessage is a fully encrypted, distributed messaging service designed with speed in mind.
Originally based off of BitMessage, StrongMessage makes modifications to the API to include
both Read Receipts that Purge the network of read messages, and an extra identification field
to prevent clients from having to decrypt every single incoming message.
